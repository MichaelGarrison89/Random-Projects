# Random-Projects
Here's where I'm storing a bunch of projects that I don't have other places for.

SOTU Markov Chain -- One R file to pull the text of every US State of the Union Address; 
                     one R file to randomly generate a Markov chain based on the SOTU historical text.

NFL Monte Carlo -- Files for NFL Forecasting Project. This folder includes the Projections.csv file, with
                   my estimates for true team quality going into 2015, the schedule file with this season's team                        schedule, and the R file that runs 50k simulations of the upcoming NFL season.
